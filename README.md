Google Foobar Challenge 1 Task 1 - Re-ID

My attempt at Challenge 1 Task 1 - Re-ID of Google Foobar. From what I can remember, I found this level quite easy.

I was extremely excited to be able to take part in this challenge - I told everyone I knew. The notification came up randomly in lesson and I just had to take the opportunity.
